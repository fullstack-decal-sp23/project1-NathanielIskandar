                <h3> Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS), B.S</h3>
                <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS). I am an avid tech enthusiast and I love working with people!</p>
                <p>I am honored to be a recipient for the <strong>Student of Distinction Award</strong> in the <strong>Academic Achievement Category</strong> recognized by the <strong>California State Congress</strong> including  Senator Josh Newman, U.S. Representative Young Kim, and U.S Congresswoman Grace F. Napolitano.</p>
                <p>In association with the Google Developers Community, I serve as the President/Lead of the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), a student-led initiative by Google that aims to bring awareness about technology!</p>
                <p>Outside of school, I love to surf, work out, and sunset wathing by the coast. Feel free to reach out and connect!</p>
